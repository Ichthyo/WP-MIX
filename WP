Abstract:

Monkey (m0nk3y) Capital creates the first Inter-Blockchain fungibility mechanism [the Monkey Crypto Asset eXchange Platform (MCAXP)] allowing Inter-Blockchain exchange of a family of Waves and ER20 based existing Token Assets, and ceates the first Venture Currency [Monkey Inter-Exchange Token (MIX)] that is 1:1 fungible with a myriad of Monkey and Non-Monkey Tokens. 

Intro: 

While Blockchain Tokens have utility within their own system (typically either as use-case or store-of-value), they are vertically locked.  That is, with the exception of trading one blockchain token against another (value against value) on token exchanges, Tokens function only within their own blockchain, and only for specific and limited use cases.  The Monkey (m0nk3y) Crypto Assex eXchange Platform (MCAXP) will Liberate Token Utility to create numerous options for value creation, and will do this via novel 2 mechanisms. 

1. The Monkey (m0nk3y) Inter-Exchange Software (MIXS) will allow real Inter-Blockchain transactions, meaning true 1:1 blockchain fungibility, and will redefine Tokens, Blockchains, and Utility. 

2. MIXS will also upcycle dormant or devalued tokens by accepting token submissions and remitting Monkey Inter-Exchange (MIX) Tokens in return, thereby producing further inter blockchain utility options.
