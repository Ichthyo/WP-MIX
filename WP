ABSTRACT:

Monkey (m0nk3y) creates the first Inter-Blockchain fungibility mechanism [the Monkey Crypto Asset eXchange Platform (MCAXP)] allowing Inter-Blockchain exchange of a family of Waves and ER20 based existing Token Assets, and ceates the first Venture Currency [Monkey Inter-Exchange Token (MIX)] that is 1:1 fungible with a myriad of Monkey and Non-Monkey Tokens.  These blockchain innovations are made possible by Proof of Work (POW) mining. 



INTRODUCTION: 

While Blockchain Tokens have utility within their own system (typically either as use-case or store-of-value), they are vertically locked.  That is, with the exception of trading one blockchain token against another (value against value) on token exchanges, Tokens function only within their own blockchain, and only for specific and limited use cases.  The Monkey (m0nk3y) Crypto Asset eXchange Platform (MCAXP) will liberate token utility and change the way in which tokens can create value.  MCAXP will do this via the novel mechanism named Proof of Value (POV) mining.  POV mining has 3 value components. 

1.	POV mining will allow Inter-blockchain transactions via Blockchain Transfer Gateways (BTG’s).  BTG’s will allow real Inter-Blockchain transactions, meaning true 1:1 blockchain fungibility, among designated assets.  True Inter-Blockchain transactions will further redefine tokens, blockchains, value, and utility.

2.	POV mining will also provide Token Immigration.  POV Token Immigration works like this: when any class or type of a predetermined token is sent to a specific Token Immigration Gateway (TIG) by a holder, the holder receives another newly minted token (a Monkey Inter-Exchange (MIX) Token) on the Venture Currency Blockchain, either at the same address or in another address of their choice elsewhere.  

3.	Additionally, POV mining provides Blockchain Token Gateways (BTGs) Token Immigration Gateways (TIGs) and Proof of Value token holders (Coeval Alpha) crypto rewards. 



MONKEY CRYTPO ASSET EXCHANGE PLATFORM (MCAXP) COMPONENTS:

1.	Proof of Value (POV) mining and Blockchain Transfer Gateways (BTGs) in Inter-Blockchain Transfers:

Inter-Blockchain Transfers (bidirectional and multidirectional function).

POV mining allows Inter-Blockchain Transfer (bidirectional and multidirectional) via Blockchain specific Blockchain Transfer Gateways (BTGs) and provides the mechanism by which existing Waves and ER20 based Monkey Token Assets may be transferred from one blockchain to another. 

There are currently 14 Monkey Assets:

  Waves Tokens
  COE, MNY, ZUS, MARS, PRE, PVT, PLC, KEY, CHANCE, PLAYER, COA
  
  Ethereum Tokens
  PRE, COE, MNY (pending)
  
Via specified BTGs, any of these tokens may be transferred from their native blockchain to any of the other blockchains.  The transfers are bidirectional and multidirectional.  In the bidirectional example, MNY (waves) could be sent to the PRE Blockchain Transfer Gateway (PREBTG) and transferred to the PRE (ER20) blockchain, and then subsequently sent to the MNYBTG and transferred back to the MNY (Waves) blockchain. 

(insert bidirectional diagram). 

In the case of multidirections, MNY (waves) could be sent to the PREBTG and transferred to the PRE (ER20) blockchain, and then subsequently sent to the MARSBTG and transferred to the Mars (Waves) blockchain, and then finally sent to the PLAYERBTG and transferred to the PLAYER (Waves) blockchain.

(insert multidirectional diagram)


2.	Proof of Value (POV) mining and Token Immigration Gateways (TIGs) in Token Immigraion:
 
Token Immigration (unidirectional only)

Via POV mining, when non-Monkey tokens are sent to a specified Token Immigration Gateways (TIG), newly created Monkey Inter-Exchange (MIX) tokens are remitted to the wallet of the sender, constituting a Token Immigration opportunity for dormant or devalued tokens to assume new functionality in the active Monkey Inter-Exchange (MIX) Blockchain.  For example, if a wallet holder sends in a token to the TIG, the TIG issues a Monkey Inter-Exchange (MIX) token back to their wallet.  This functions as an additional source of utility and value to the Monkey assets and will also, in the future, provide a mechanism to upcycle and reuse dormant and devalued tokens.  Token Immigration provides the opportunity to synergize with existing, functioning Monkey Asset Blockchains and also allows the opportunity to recapture token utility that had been overlooked, under-realized, or abandoned in other tokens.  POV mining and Token Immigration innovates new token utility via the relationship between blockchains.

Unlike Inter-Blockchain Transfers, Token Immigration is unidirectional.  Once tokens have Immigrated to the MIX blockchain and have become MIX Tokens, they can not return to their original blockchain or assume their original Token status. 

(insert diagram here)

The Immigration Exchange Rate of Token Immigration will be different for each incoming assets and will be noted on the MCAXP. 

2B. Proof of Value (POV) mining reward.

Each Blockchain Transfer Gateway (BTG) and each Token Immigration Gateway (TIG) as well as Coeval alpha (COA) will receive crytpo rewards related to POV mining. 



3.	Monkey Inter-Exchange (MIX) Tokens

MIX tokens, which are issued upon Immigration from external blockchains, will function as the sole token in the Venture Currency blockchain. 

(questions here on how issuance will related to quantity of MIX).


BLOCKCHAINS HARDFORKS, BLOCKCHAIN TRANSFERS, AND TOKEN IMMIGRATION:

In order to create greater utility via multi-fungibility, we will employ a hardfork on the Ethereum Blockchain.  Current Monkey Token Assets As a results include:

 Waves Tokens
  COE, MNY, ZUS, MARS, PRE, PVT, PLC, KEY, CHANCE, PLAYER, COA
  
  Ethereum Tokens
  PRE, COE, MNY (pending)
  
When we implement the Ethereum Fork we will then have:

 Waves Tokens
  COE, MNY, ZUS, MARS, PRE, PVT, PLC, KEY, CHANCE, PLAYER, COA
  
 Ethereum Tokens
  PRE, COE, MNY (pending)
  
 Ethereum Classic Tokens 
  PRE, COE, MNY (pending 
  
There will be multi-fungibility (Blockchain Transfer) among the following blockchains. 

1. Waves
2. Ethereum
3. Ethereum Classic

Additionally, on the Venure Currency Blockchain, MIX, will function as the 

Venture Currency
